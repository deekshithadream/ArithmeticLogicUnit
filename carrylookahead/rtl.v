//The Carry Look-Ahead Adder (CLA) is designed to speed up binary addition by precomputing carry bits instead of waiting for them to propagate. 
//This method makes it significantly faster than traditional ripple-carry adders.
//Instead of waiting for carries to propagate through each bit sequentially (like in ripple-carry adders), the CLA precomputes all carry bits at once.
//This reduces the delay and improves overall performance, making it useful in high-speed processors and digital arithmetic operations.
